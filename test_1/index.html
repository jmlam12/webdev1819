    In this exercise, use CSS to make everything written below true. You may add as many classes to elements as you want.

      Every section should have a green 3px dotted border, except this one, which should have a light blue background color, and a box  shadow of 10px with rounded corners.
    </p>
  
  <p>
    All sections should have 1 line of space between them. And they should all have 12px of padding on left and right.

    <blockquote>
        Most <em><mark>emphasis</mark></em> should have a yellow background, but
        not <em>this one</em>.

        I definitely don't want this blockquote indented.

      This paragraph can stay as is.
